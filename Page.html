    <h1>Heliodora</h1>
    <h4>Hilda Doolittle (1886)</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>He and I sought together,</h3>
    <h3>over the spattered table,</h3>
    <h3>rhymes and flowers,</h3>
    <h3>gifts for a name.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>He said, among others,</h3>
    <h3>I will bring</h3>
    <h3>(and the phrase was just and good, but not as good as mine,)</h3>
    <h3>"the narcissus that loves the rain."</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>We strove for a name, while the light of the lamps burnt thin and the outer dawn came in,</h3>
    <h3>a ghost, the last at the feast or the first,</h3>
    <h3>to sit within with the two that remained</h3>
    <h3>to quibble in flowers and verse over a girl's name.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>He said, "the rain loving,"</h3>
    <h3>I said, "the narcissus, drunk,</h3>
    <h3>drunk with the rain."</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Yet I had lost</h3>
    <h3>for he said,</h3>
    <h3>"the rose, the lover's gift,</h3>
    <h3>is loved of love,"</h3>
    <h3>he said it,</h3>
    <h3>"loved of love;"</h3>
    <h3>I waited, even as he spoke,</h3>
    <h3>to see the room filled with a light,</h3>
    <h3>as when in winter</h3>
    <h3>the embers catch in a wind</h3>
    <h3>when a room is dank:</h3>
    <h3>so it would be filled, I thought,</h3>
    <h3>our room with a light</h3>
    <h3>when he said</h3>
    <h3>(and he said it first)</h3>
    <h3>"the rose, the lover's delight,</h3>
    <h3>is loved of love,"</h3>
    <h3>but the light was the same.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Then he caught,</h3>
    <h3>seeing the fire in my eyes,</h3>
    <h3>my fire, my fever, perhaps,</h3>
    <h3>for he leaned</h3>
    <h3>with the purple wine</h3>
    <h3>stained on his sleeve,</h3>
    <h3>and said this:</h3>
    <h3>"did you ever think</h3>
    <h3>a girl's mouth</h3>
    <h3>caught in a kiss,</h3>
    <h3>is a lily that laughs?"</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>I had not.</h3>
    <h3>I saw it now</h3>
    <h3>as men must see it forever afterwards;</h3>
    <h3>no poet could write again,</h3>
    <h3>"the red-lily,</h3>
    <h3>a girl's laugh caught in a kiss;"</h3>
    <h3>it was his to pour in the vat</h3>
    <h3>from which all poets dip and quaff,</h3>
    <h3>for poets are brothers in this.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>So I saw the fire in his eyes,</h3>
    <h3>it was almost my fire,</h3>
    <h3>(he was younger,)</h3>
    <h3>I saw the face so white,</h3>
    <h3>my heart beat,</h3>
    <h3>it was almost my phrase;</h3>
    <h3>I said, "surprise the muses,</h3>
    <h3>take them by surprise;</h3>
    <h3>it is late,</h3>
    <h3>rather it is dawn-rise,</h3>
    <h3>those ladies sleep, the nine,</h3>
    <h3>our own king's mistresses."</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>A name to rhyme,</h3>
    <h3>flowers to bring to a name,</h3>
    <h3>what was one girl faint and shy,</h3>
    <h3>with eyes like the myrtle,</h3>
    <h3>(I said: "her underlids</h3>
    <h3>are rather like myrtle,")</h3>
    <h3>to vie with the nine?</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Let him take the name,</h3>
    <h3>he had the rhymes,</h3>
    <h3>"the rose, loved of love,</h3>
    <h3>the lily, a mouth that laughs,"</h3>
    <h3>he had the gift,</h3>
    <h3>"the scented crocus,</h3>
    <h3>the purple hyacinth,"</h3>
    <h3>what was one girl to the nine?</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>He said:</h3>
    <h3>"I will make her a wreath;"</h3>
    <h3>he said:</h3>
    <h3>"I will write it thus:</h3>
    <br>
    <h3><i>I will bring you the lily that laughs,</i></h3>
    <h3><i>I will twine</i></h3>
    <h3><i>with soft narcissus, the myrtle,</i></h3>
    <h3><i>sweet crocus, white violet,</i></h3>
    <h3><i>the purple hyacinth, and last,</i></h3>
    <h3><i>the rose, loved-of-love,</i></h3>
    <h3><i>that these may drip on your hair</i></h3>
    <h3><i>the less soft flowers,</i></h3>
    <h3><i>may mingle sweet with the sweet</i></h3>
    <h3><i>of Heliodora's locks,</i></h3>
    <h3><i>myrrh-curled."</i></h3>
    <br>
    <h3>(He wrote myrrh-curled,</h3>
    <h3>I think, the first.)</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>"they sleep, the nine,"</h3>
    <h3>when he shouted swift and passionate:</h3>
    <h3><i>"that </i>for the nine!</h3>
    <h3>above the hills</h3>
    <h3>the sun is about to wake,</h3>
    <h3><i>and to-day white violets</i></h3>
    <h3><i>shine beside white lilies</i></h3>
    <h3><i>adrift on the mountain side;</i></h3>
    <h3><i>to-day the narcissus opens</i></h3>
    <h3><i>that loves the rain."</i></h3>
    <br>
    <h3>I watched him to the door,</h3>
    <h3>catching his robe</h3>
    <h3>as the wine-bowl crashed to the floor,</h3>
    <h3>spilling a few wet lees</h3>
    <h3>(ah, his purple hyacinth!)</h3>
    <h3>I saw him out of the door,</h3>
    <h3>I thought:</h3>
    <h3>there will never be a poet</h3>
    <h3>in all the centuries after this,</h3>
    <h3>who will dare write,</h3>
    <h3>after my friend's verse,</h3>
    <h3>"a girl's mouth</h3>
    <h3>is a lily kissed."</h3>
